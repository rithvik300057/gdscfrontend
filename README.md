# gdscfrontend
this is a frontend website which is designed for selling used items 
this also has a google sign in option
this is created with html css and react
The code works completely fine but there might be an issue cause i dont know how to upload it on git hub because i did it in the last minute so you can copy and paste the code in your vscode and check it sorry for the inconvenience .
